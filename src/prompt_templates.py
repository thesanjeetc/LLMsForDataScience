<scratchpad>
Import required libraries: 'pandas as pd', 'numpy as np', 'itertools', and 'dateutil.parser.parse'.
Parse 'sale_date' column in 'sales_data' using 'sales_data["sale_date"].apply(parse)' to convert string dates to datetime objects.
Create monthly sales by category using 'sales_data.groupby(["category", pd.Grouper(key="sale_date", freq="M")])["sales"].sum().unstack(level=0)'.
Calculate month-over-month growth using '.pct_change()' method on the monthly sales DataFrame.
Generate category pairs for comparison using 'itertools.combinations(monthly_growth.columns, 2)' to create all possible pairs.
Detect unusual patterns by iterating through each category in 'monthly_growth.columns' and applying 'detect_unusual_pattern()' function to each category's data.
Find top growing categories by calculating average growth for each category using 'monthly_growth.mean()' and selecting the top 5 categories with highest average growth using '.nlargest(5)'.
Print results by printing 'unusual_patterns' and 'top_growing'.

Calculate the average daily temperature fluctuation for each month, identify months with the highest variability, and determine if there's a correlation between temperature range and precipitation levels.
</question>
<scratchpad>
Import necessary libraries: 'pandas as pd' and 'numpy as np'.
Convert 'date' column to datetime using 'pd.to_datetime(weather_data['date'])'.
Calculate daily temperature range by subtracting 'min_temp' from 'max_temp' and store the result in a new column 'temp_range'.
Extract month from date using 'weather_data['date'].dt.month' and store in a new column 'month'.
Group data by month and calculate the average temperature range using 'groupby('month')['temp_range'].mean()' and store the result in 'monthly_avg_fluctuation'.
Identify months with highest variability by sorting 'monthly_avg_fluctuation' in descending order using 'sort_values(ascending=False)' and select the top 3 months using 'head(3)'.
Calculate the correlation between temperature range and precipitation using 'corr()' function on 'temp_range' and 'precipitation' columns and store the result in 'correlation'.
Print results by printing 'monthly_avg_fluctuation', 'highest_variability', and 'correlation'.

Analyze customer purchasing behavior across different age groups and regions, identifying trends in product preferences and seasonal buying patterns.

Extract season from purchase date using 'customer_data['purchase_date'].dt.month.map()' with a custom dictionary to map months to seasons, storing in a new column 'season'.
Group data by age group, region, product, and season using 'groupby(['age_group', 'region', 'product', 'season'])' and aggregate sales using 'sum()'.
Calculate product preferences for each age group and region using 'groupby(['age_group', 'region', 'product'])' and 'idxmax()' to find the most popular product.
Analyze seasonal trends using 'unstack(level='season')' to reshape data for seasonal comparison and calculate percentage change using 'pct_change()'.
Identify top products for each age group by grouping by age group and product using 'groupby(['age_group', 'product'])' and use 'nlargest(3)' to find top 3 products per age group.
